# ObjectiX: Intelligent Object Detection and ROI Classification

## Project Overview

**ObjectiX** is an advanced project aimed at developing intelligent object detection and classification capabilities using state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The primary focus of this project is to train the **ResAttention** model for effectively classifying specific regions of interest (ROIs) in images. This technology has the potential to enhance various applications, including autonomous vehicles, robotics, augmented reality, and smart surveillance systems.

The project's innovative approach combines deep learning techniques with a robust dataset, ensuring high accuracy and efficiency in object detection and classification tasks.

## Objectives

- To implement a cutting-edge CNN architecture (ResAttention) for object detection and classification.
- To train the model on the comprehensive COCO dataset, ensuring it learns from a diverse range of objects and scenes.
- To evaluate and optimize the model's performance, focusing on its ability to accurately classify specific ROIs in various images.
- To leverage GPU acceleration for enhanced training speed and efficiency in future iterations.

### Dataset Information

- **Dataset Used**: COCO dataset (train 2017 set)
- **Total Images**: 118,287 images
- **Categories**: The COCO dataset includes 80 object categories, providing a rich source of data for training robust models.

### Training Configuration

- **Batch Size**: 20 samples per iteration
- **Number of Epochs**: 10 epochs
- **Initial Training Environment**: 
  - Platform: Google Colab
  - Instance Type: Vertex AI Efficient Instance with 4 vCPUs and 16 GB RAM
  - Training Mode: CPU-only

### Training Progress and Results

- The initial training phase has been successfully executed in a CPU-only environment.
- Training logs and checkpoints have been generated, saving key model states from `100.torch` to `700.torch`. These checkpoints allow for potential resumption of training without starting from scratch.

### Challenges Faced

- Training a large dataset on a CPU-only instance has resulted in longer training times and limited batch sizes. This has motivated the transition to a more powerful GPU-enabled environment to facilitate faster training and improved performance.

## Next Steps

1. **Transition to a CUDA-Enabled Environment**:
   - The next phase involves setting up a CUDA-enabled environment to leverage GPU resources effectively. This will significantly reduce training time and enhance the model's ability to learn from data.
  
2. **Configuration of GPU Resources**:
   - Ensure that the environment is properly configured for GPU access, including installing necessary drivers and libraries.
  
3. **Enhanced Training**:
   - Increase batch sizes and the number of epochs for further training to improve the model’s accuracy and robustness.
   - Conduct thorough evaluations of the model's performance and fine-tune hyperparameters as necessary.

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - After the transition to the GPU environment, conduct extensive testing and validation of the model's predictions on a separate validation set to gauge performance and identify areas for improvement.

## Future Directions

- Explore the integration of additional techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and ensemble methods to further enhance model accuracy and reliability.
- Investigate potential applications of the trained model in real-world scenarios, focusing on areas such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and security systems.
